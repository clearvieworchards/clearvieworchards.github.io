      Clearview Orchards produces the finest CCOF certified organic apples. Whether you want to pick your own apples or simply pick up some organic fruit from our Apple Barn to take home, Clearview Orchards is the place to create lifelong memories. Bring the family out for the Watsonville apple picking experience. In addition to apples, we also sell fresh apple juice, delicious apple turnovers, organic squash, pumpkins, strawberries, dried lavender, and honey. The orchards are in a beautiful terraced setting overlooking the valley of Watsonville. We are just a mile from La Selva beach.
